title: "Not that Marx"
---

Hello, I'm pitermarx. You can find me in many places in the interwebz

It's not a reference to [this Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx), nor [that Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), just a pun on my real name.

You can see [HERE](categories/shares/) stuff I've shared over the years and [HERE](categories/original/) stuff of my own authorship. I mostly write on [software topics](tags/dev/) or [religion](tags/christianity/). Read [here](resume/) a prose version of my resume.
