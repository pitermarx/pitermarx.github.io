I just read [this article](http://jsomers.net/blog/gettiers) about the [Gettier problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem) and found the concept pretty interesting. I have a few comments.

It might be true that even though I have a [JTB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief#Justified_true_belief) about something I might be wrong. Nevertheless, I think It would be resonable to act upon a JTB as if it was true. For all practical purposes, it is true to the best of my knowledge. This does not mean I shun new information that might make me to change my JTB. And if having a JTB is not knowledge, what is? What can we know? We can always imagine a world where even our most firm JTB might be false.

If a JTB is not a good case to use the word knowledge I don’t know what is…
