> **Whitehorse – “Broken” (live)**
>
> Two of Canada’s more inventive modern songwriters, husband/wife duo Luke Doucet and Melissa McClelland teamed up last year to form Whitehorse.  Expectedly drawing from blues-rock and alt country, Whitehorse succeed both in harmony and when Doucet and McClelland trade off verses.  Fans of Gillian Welch and David Rawling’s interplay will surely be drawn into Whitehorse’s back and forth.  Being a couple in life translates well to their music.  There’s an endearing quality to watching these established artists interact playfully both in lyric and performance.  This will surely be a strong set amidst any showcase at SXSW this year.
