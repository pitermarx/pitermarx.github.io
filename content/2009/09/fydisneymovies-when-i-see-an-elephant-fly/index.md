> When I See An Elephant Fly - Dumbo

> I saw a peanut stand, heard a rubber band,  
> And seen a needle wink its eye  
> But I be done seen about everything  
> When I see an elephant fly  
> When I see an elephant fly  
> I’ve seen a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring  
> I’ve seen a polka dot railroad tie  
> But I be done seen about everything  
> When I see an elephant fly  
>   
> I saw a clothes horse rear up and buck  
> And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck  
> I didn’t see that, I only heard  
> Just to be sociable, well, I’ll take your word  
>   
> I heard a fireside chat, I saw a baseball bat  
> And I just laughed till I thought I’d die  
> But I be done seen about everything  
> When I see an elephant fly

> But I be done seen about everything
