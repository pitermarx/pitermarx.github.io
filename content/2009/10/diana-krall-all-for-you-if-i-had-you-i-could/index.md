**Diana Krall - All For You - If i Had You**

I could show the world how to smile  
I could be glad all of the while  
I could turn the gray skies to blue  
If I had you  
  
I could leave my old days behind  
Leave all my pals and never mind  
There is nothing I couldn’t do  
If I had you  
  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross a burning desert  
If I had you by my side  
  
I could be a queen dear on ground  
Humble or poor  
Rich or renown  
There is nothing I couldn’t do  
If I had you
