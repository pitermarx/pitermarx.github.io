**Nick Drake - Pink Moon - Place to be**

When I was younger, younger than before  
I never saw the truth hanging from the door  
And now Im older see it face to face  
And now Im older gotta get up clean the place.

And I was green, greener than the hill  
Where the flowers grew and the sun shone still  
Now Im darker than the deepest sea  
Just hand me down, give me a place to be.  
  
And I was strong, strong in the sun  
I thought Id see when day is done  
Now Im weaker than the palest blue  
Oh, so weak in this need for you.
