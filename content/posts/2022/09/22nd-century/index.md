  There is no oxygen in the air
  Men and women have lost their hair
  Ashen faces, legs that stand
  Ghost and goblins walk in this land

  When tomorrow becomes yesterday
  And tomorrow becomes eternity
  When the soul with the soul goes way beyond
  When life is taken and there are no more babies born
  When there is no one and there is everyone
  When there is no one and there is everyone

  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  It will be, it will be, it will be
  It will be, it will be

  The 21st century was here and gone
  And the 20th century was the dawn
  In the beginning of the end was the 21st
  When the 20th century was at an end

  1990 was the year when the plagues flooded the earth
  1988 was the year when men and women struck out for freedom
  And bloodletting was the thing that was
  People said there was no cause
  And there was no reason and there was no cause
  1972 was right all the way
  Drums and bugles blasting all through the day
  Right wing, left wing, middle of the road
  And side wind, back swing, back lash, whiplash
  Grey stockings, red stockings
  Liberation of women, libertion of men
  Everyody carry your head low

  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  It will be, it will be, it will be
  It will be

  Liberation of animals
  Prevention of cruelty to animals
  Man and beast, flying and on flying
  Flying things, revolution of music
  Poetry, love and lives
  Sex changing, changing, changing
  Man is woman, woman is man
  Even your brain is not your brain
  Your heart is a plastic thing that can be bought
  There are no more the diseases that can't be caught
<strong>
  Man became the thing, that he worship
  Man truly became his god
  That was the day that man and woman truly became bored
  Man became his good, man became his evil
  Man became his god, and man became his devil
</strong>
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  It will be, it will be, it will be

  Young women without money caught
  Big dogs living in marble loves
  Young men die in the spring
  Boys of seven falling in love
  Give their lady fair a diamond ring
  Wedding, wedding, wedding
  You know a wedding ain't the thing
  Don't want no preacher, don't want no preacherman preaching
  Give me your hand, and take my hand
  This is better than anybody's preacher man, yeah
  The truth, the truth is now on pole
  It says somebody else, somebody else, so am I told
  Don't sway me over, don't try to sway me over
  To your day, on your day
  Your day will go away

  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  Tomorrow will be the 22nd century
  It will be, it will be, it will be
  It will be, it will be, it will be
  It will be, it will be, it will be
  It will be
