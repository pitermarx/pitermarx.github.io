> Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
> I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.
> â€” <cite>[Exodus 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+17&version=NIV)</cite>
