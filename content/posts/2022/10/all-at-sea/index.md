<pre>
I'm all at sea
Where no one can bother me
Forgot my roots
If only for a day
Just me and my thoughts
Singing far away

Like a warm drink, it seeps into my soul
Please just leave me right here on my own
Later on you could spend some time with me
If you want to
All at sea

I'm all at sea
Where no one can bother me
I sleep by myself
I drink on my own
I don't speak to nobody
I gave away my own phone

Like a warm drink, it seeps into my soul
Please just leave me right here on my own
Later on you could spend some time with me
If you want to
All at sea

Now I need you more than ever
I need you more than ever, now
If you don't need it everyday
But sometimes don't you just crave
To disappear within your mind?
You never know what you might find
So come and spend some time with me
And we will spend it all at sea

Like a warm drink it seeps into my soul
Please just leave me right here on my own
Later on you could spend some time with me
If you want to
All at sea

If you want to
All at sea
If you want to
</pre>
