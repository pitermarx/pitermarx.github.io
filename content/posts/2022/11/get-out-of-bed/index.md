> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself:
> “I am rising to do the work of a human being. What do I have to complain about, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do?
> Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”
> — But it’s nicer here …
> So were you born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them?
> Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can?
> And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
> — But we have to sleep sometime…
> Agreed. But nature set a limit on that — as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit.
> You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There’s still more of that to do.
>
> — <cite> Marcus Aurelius - Meditations (Book 5, Paragraph 1) </cite>
