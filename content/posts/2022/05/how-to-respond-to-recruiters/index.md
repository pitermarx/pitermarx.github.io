Hello \[name\]

Thanks so much for reaching out. I’m always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there.

As a software engineer with over \[number\] years of experience I’m sure you can imagine that I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn. It is a wonderful position of privilege to be in and I’m thankful for it.

It does however mean that I don’t have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the times, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I’d like to level set around the level of seniority that you’re looking for.

Can you send along the company/project name, role description and the total compensation details for the role you’re reaching out in reference to?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Pedro
