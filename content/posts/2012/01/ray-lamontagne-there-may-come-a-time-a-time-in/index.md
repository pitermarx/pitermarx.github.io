  There may come a time
  A time in everyone’s life
  Where nothing seems to go your way
  Where nothing seems to turn out right

  There may come a time
  You just can’t seem to find your way
  For every door you open
  Seems like they get slammed in your face

  That’s when you need someone
  Someone that you can call
  And when all your faith is gone
  Feels like you can’t go on

  Let it be me, let it be me
  If it’s a friend that you need
  Let it be me, let it be me

  Feels like your always coming up last
  Pockets full of nothin’ and you got no cash
  No matter where you turn, you ain’t got no place to stand
  Reach out for something and they slap your hand

  Now I remember all too well
  Just how it feels to be all alone
  You feel like you’d give anything
  For just a little place you can call your own

  That’s when you need someone
  Someone that you can call
  And when all your faith is gone
  Feels like you can’t go on

  Let it be me, let it be me
  If it’s a friend you need
  Let it be me, let it be me

  Let it be me, let it be me
  If it’s a friend you need
  Let it be me, let it be me
  Let it be me
