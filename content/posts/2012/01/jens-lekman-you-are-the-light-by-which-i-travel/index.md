  Yeah I got busted
  so I used my one phone call to dedicate a song to you on the radio

  Yeah I got busted.
  In custody I imagined our melody being played on a grand piano

  I saw your face in front of me. It was perfect clarity.
  I saw a light in the end of the tunnel

  And it was you ‘cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
  you are the light, you are the light by which I travel into this and that

  Yeah I got busted.
  I painted a dirty word on your old man’s Mercedes Benz 'cause you told me to do it

  Yeah I got busted
  but soon they released me cause the cops were sad and they didn’t know how to prove it

  I saw your face in front of me. It was perfect clarity
  I saw a light in the end of the tunnel

  And it was you 'cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
  you are the light, you are the light by which I travel into this and that

  It’s all so obvious, so obvious
  Why would anyone need a map or a compass?
  It’s so beautiful to be guided by you

  'Cause you are the light, you are the light by which I travel into this and that
  You are the light, you are the light by which I travel into this and that
