In March 2021, I left the company and the project that I worked for 9 years. This is my goodbye message.

If I'm going to be completely honest, I never liked to read this kind of goodbye messages, but now that it's my turn to go, I feel compelled to write something. Now more than ever when we cannot see each other face to face, I want to leave a few words to you. People seem to think that when we are going through this kind of transition, suddenly we are filled with a burst of wisdom and thus are more willing to hear us out.

I've been a part of [Critical Software](https://www.linkedin.com/company/critical-software/) since 2012 and had my share of high and low moments, but overall I **know** this has been an invaluable experience. As our last [CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goncaloquadros/) used to say, this company is a real "_school of engineering_", for those that are willing to learn. It's not because we are so much smarter than everyone else, but because we are willing to empower ourselves to experiment, learn and improve on the job.

In these 9 years I've only worked on **_one_** project, [Verticalla](https://www.linkedin.com/company/verticalla/)'s [VisionCenter](http://www.verticalla.ch/en/solutions/vision-center/overview). I can affirm proudly that I'm in part responsible for it's success. Nevertheless, even though I enjoyed very much the work I've done, upon some reflection I've come to the realization that what stays most fondly in my memory are the relationships I've built over the years.

Those who know me, are aware that I'm **not** very good at building and keeping such relationships but I'm **grateful** that some of you took the time and patience to get to know me and become more than mere co-workers. I advise everyone get to know the people that you work with and befriend them, even though some of them (like myself) are not very friendly. It will bring benefits not only to your personal life (it's nice to have friends) but also to your work! When we like the ones we work with, we are (1) more available to listen to them and (2) to be more sympathetic to their shortcomings. This raises the levels of trust, which in turn increases productivity, morale, team work and overall happiness.

Some of the friends I've made at Critical Software, are no longer working there - like [Nuno Sousa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nesousa/), [Ricardo Guerra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjguerra/) and [Pedro Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-f-da-costa/), my mentors - but many still are. Thank you [Tiago Carregã](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagocarrega/) for the chess games (I know I suck), [Luisa Barbosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisa-barbosa-9267659b/) for telling me to shut up, [Catarina Azevedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catarina-azevedo1512/) for the good mood in the office, [Agne Pustovoitaite](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agn%C4%97-pustovoitait%C4%97-97b5a183/) for the Lithuanian lessons, Paulo Silva for the music, [Matt Brake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattbrake/) for being very approachable

Also, from [Sauter](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sauter/) side, I really enjoyed working with [Patrice Hell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-hell-454b8744/) and [Hartmut Melchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hartmut-melchin-49923998/), both being top quality professionals. I cannot name you all but, thanks to [Benjamim Cardoso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamim/), [Carla Machado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carla-machado-b3440329/), [Telmo Inácio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/telmoinacio), [Jorge Ribeiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-alves-8ab0742/), [Hugo Sousa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hansousa/), [Ricardo Lamarão](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-lamar%C3%A3o/), [Luís Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lnors/), [Nuno Alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nunoalexandrealves/), [João Carloto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-carloto-7993b164/), [Braselina Sousa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/braselina-sousa-85a5463/) and so many others that had a good influence on me.

So thank you all and goodbye!

As we're approaching [Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter), and this is one of the most important times of the year for a christian like me, I want also to leave you with some thoughts about Jesus and his resurrection.

- Christianity is a fact-based religion and the resurrection is the most important of those facts.
- If Jesus did not rise from the dead, then Christianity is false and life ends on the grave
    - There is no heaven or hell
    - There is no punishment for evil
    - There is no reward for good
    - Jesus' death is just another death
- If Jesus did rise from the dead, then Christianity is true and life does not end on the grave
    - There is hope of heaven
    - Evil will be punished
    - Good will be rewarded
    - Jesus' death unlocks the door to eternal life

When we have assurance of the fact of the resurrection:

- However bad things get in this life, heaven is secure for us.
- We have peace over the death of our loved ones, because they are not gone forever.
- Christ's resurrection is the basis of the trust we have of our own resurrection. He conquered death.

In short, being sure that the resurrection really occurred, is of great importance. Don't take my word for it. Check for yourselves!

If you do the research and find out I'm wrong, you just lost a bit of time.

If you do the research and find out I'm right, you also lost a bit of time but gained eternity.
