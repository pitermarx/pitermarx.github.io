Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you’ve had too much
Come back in focus again

The walls abandon shape
They’ve got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you’re comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you’re lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What’s the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you’re lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Jigsaw falling into place
There is nothing to explain
Regard each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
Not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You’ve got a light you can feel it on your back
A light you can feel it on your back
Jigsaw falling into place
