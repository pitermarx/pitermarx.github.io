_Lovers are very special people.
They’re the luckiest people in the world._

With one person, one very special person,
a feeling deep in your soul
says you were half; now you’re whole.
No more hunger and thirst.
But first be a person who needs people.

_People — people who need people
are the luckiest people in the world._
