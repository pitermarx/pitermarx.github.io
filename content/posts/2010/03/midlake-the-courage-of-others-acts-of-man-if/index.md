  If all that grows starts to fade, starts to falter
  Oh let me inside, let me inside not to wake
  Let all that run through the fields, through the quiet
  Go on with their own, on with their own hidden ways

  When all the newness of gold travels far from
  Where it had once been worn like the earth over years
  And when the acts of man cause the ground to break open
  Oh let me inside, let me inside not to wake

  Great are the sounds of all that live and all that man can hold

  If all that grows starts to fade, starts to falter
  Oh let me inside, let me inside not to wake

  Great are the sounds of all that live and all that man can hold
