  Looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
  Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
  And maybe i’m too young to keep good love from going wrong
  But tonight you’re on my mind so you never know

  Broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
  Where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it
  Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run

  Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
  And much too blind to see the damage he’s done
  Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one

  So i’ll wait for you and i’ll burn
  Will I ever see your sweet return
  Oh will I ever learn
  Oh lover, you should’ve come over
  ‘Cause it’s not too late

  Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
  Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him 
  My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come

  It’s never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
  It’s never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her
  It’s never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
  It’s never over, she’s the tear that hangs inside my soul forever

  Well maybe i’m just too young 
  To keep good love from going wrong 

  Oh… lover, you should’ve come over

  Well I feel too young to hold on
  And i’m much too old to break free and run
  Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage i’ve done
  Sweet lover, you should’ve come over
  Oh, love well i’m waiting for you

  Lover, you should’ve come over
  'Cause it’s not too late
