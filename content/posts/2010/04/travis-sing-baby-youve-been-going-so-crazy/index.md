  Baby, you’ve been going so crazy,
  Lately nothing seems to be going right.
  So low, why do you have to get so low?
  You’re so…
  You’ve been waiting in the sun too long.

  But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,
  For the love you bring won’t mean a thing,
  Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing.

  Colder, crying over your shoulder,
  Hold her, tell her everything’s gonna be fine.
  Surely, you’ve been going too early,
  Hurry ‘cos no-one’s gonna be stopped.
  Na na na na…

  But if you sing, sing, sing, sing sing, sing.
  For the love you bring won’t mean a thing.
  Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,

  Baby, there’s something going on today,
  But I say nothing, nothing, nothing…

  But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,
  For the love you bring won’t mean a thing,
  Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing.

  Ohh baby sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,
  For the love you bring won’t mean a thing,
  Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
