Long afloat on shipless oceans I did all my best to smile
‘Til your singing eyes and fingers drew me loving to your isle
And you sang 'sail to me, sail to me let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am , waiting to hold you’

Did I dream you dreamed about me? Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning, broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing, 'touch me not, touch me not. Come back tomorrow
Oh, my heart, oh, my heart shies from the sorrow’

I am as puzzled as the oyster. I am as troubled at the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers or should I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing 'Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you’
