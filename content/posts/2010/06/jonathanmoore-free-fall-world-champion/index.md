> World champion freediver Guillaume Nery dives to the bottom of Dean’s Blue Hole at a depth of 202m filmed entirely on breath hold.  This movie was made to bring attention to freediving and show another approach to freedliving videos.  Editing by BLUENERY (Guillaume’s girlfriend) and music by Archive.  Shot with the Canon 5D Mark II.
>
> > We wanted to express the strength of the elements water-earth-air and the sensations of freedom, harmony, exploration.
