  The tramp moves on to the end of the street
  I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet
  For some there’s a future to find
  But I think they’re leaving me behind.

  The world hurries on at its breakneck pace
  People fly by in their lifelong race
  For them there’s a future to find
  But I think they’re leaving me behind.

  The chances they come, but the chances have been lost
  Success can be gained, but at too great a cost
  For some there’s a future to find
  But I think they’re leaving me behind.

  The wind sweeps up and goes back to its tree
  The rain flows by and moves to the sea
  For them there’s a future to find
  But I think they’re leaving me behind.
