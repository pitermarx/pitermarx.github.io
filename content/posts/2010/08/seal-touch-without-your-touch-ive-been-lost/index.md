  Without your touch I’ve been lost without the things I love
  Without your kiss I’ve been dreaming of the things I miss
  Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touch
  Your eyes, your mouth, your face, your touch

  Who am I, a man to tell, of what would be, no one knows
  Who am I, a man to tell, of what would be, let it be

  Without your kiss I’ve been dreaming of the things I miss like
  Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touc
  Your eyes, your mouth, your face

  Who am I, a man to tell, of what would be, no one knows
  Who am I, a man to tell, of what would be, let it be

  Still I need to know, what time it self, will really show
  Still I need to know, what time it self, can really show

  And I say
  Who am I, a man to tell, of what would be, no one knows
  Who am I, a man to tell, of what would be, let it be

  Your face, your touch.
