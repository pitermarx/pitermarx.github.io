  Look around at everyone
  Everyone looks alive and waiting
  The wind is up, the stars out
  The sun is calm, the light is fading
  But we are

  Still counting on cannibal resource
  Ok, open your eyes
  I think you’re more than a terrified witness
  Behind the arbitrary line

  Can it ask a question?
  Can it sing a a melody?
  Can it be interpreted?
  Or is it more than what the eye can see?
  Maybe not

  Still counting on cannibal resource
  Ok, open your eyes
  I think you’re more than a terrified witness
  Behind the arbitrary line

  I’m cyrin’, I’m cryin' 

  Still counting on cannibal resource
  Ok, open your eyes
  I think you’re more than a terrified witness
  Behind the arbitrary line
  The arbitrary line
  The arbitrary line
  The arbitrary line
