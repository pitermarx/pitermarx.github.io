  Come down off your throne, leave your body alone
  Somebody’s got to change
  You are the reason I have been waiting for so long
  Somebody holds the key, and it ain’t me

  Well, I’m near the end and I just ain’t got the time
  What’s more I’m wasted and can’t find my way home

  Come down on your own, leave your money at home
  Somebody’s got to change
  You are the reason I have been waiting all these years
  Somebody holds the key

  Well, I’m near the end and I just ain’t got the time
  What’s more I’m wasted and I can’t find my way home

  Come down off your throne, leave your body alone
  Somebody’s got to change
  You are the reason I have been waiting for so long
  Somebody holds the key and it ain’t me

  Well, I’m near the end and I just ain’t got the time
  What’s more I’m wasted and can’t find my way home
