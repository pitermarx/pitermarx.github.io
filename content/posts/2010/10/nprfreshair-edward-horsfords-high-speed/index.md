Edward Horsford’s high-speed photography freezes the spherical innards of water balloons — just as the balloon skins break open, and just before they splash to the floor. He works at night in his garden in London, using flashes to light the action. Amazingly, he works alone. [So how does he do it?](http://www.npr.org/blogs/pictureshow/2010/10/13/130536054/water-balloons&sc=tumblr&cc=freshair) And doesn’t he get soaked?
