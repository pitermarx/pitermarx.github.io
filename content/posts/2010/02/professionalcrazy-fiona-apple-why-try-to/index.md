<pre>
  I’m sentimental, so i walk in the rain.
  I’ve got some habits even i can’t explain.
  Go to the corner, i end up in spain
  Why try to change me now?

  I sit and daydream, i’ve got daydreams galore
  Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
  I go away weekends and leave my keys in the door
  But why try to change me now?

  Why can’t i be more conventional
  People talk, andd they stare so i try
  But that cant be, because i can’t see
  My kind of crazy world go passing me by

  So let people wonder, let ‘em laugh, let 'em frown
  You know i’ll love you till the moon’s upside down
  Don’t you remember I was always your clown
  Why try to change me now?
