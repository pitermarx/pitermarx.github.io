I really can't do web design. I'm terrible at it. My aesthetic sense is similar to that of a color-blind guinea pig.

Chat GPT to the rescue! ([Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) too!)

I had for a long time a project to implement, which was a simple webpage where what I perceive to be the fundamental tennets of cristianity are clearly presented.
I had the rough structure of the content already prepared, and all I had to do was ask the AI to write me a suitable website for it.

Believe it or not it was done in 3 prompts.

1. "Can you create me a website with the title 'The Gospel of Jesus Christ'?"
2. "Make it a bit more more modern. This is the content <my content>"
3. "Make it more beautiful"

This was the result https://blog.pitermarx.com/oevangelhodecristo/en/. I'm no designer but I think it looks nice!
If I can do this with the artistic sensibility of a brick, I know that you can do great things.
The only manual work was to find an image, because the design just had a blank space for it, and even for that I asked the AI for guidance.

After this initial design was done, I decided it would be interesting to add some content to each bullet point, to explain better in detail the basics of the christian faith.
For each bullet point, I asked the AI to generate me a webpage, with up to 500 words, wiht a bible based explanation. Again, it did so flawlessly. I did not have to edit anything.

I had done everything [in portuguese](https://blog.pitermarx.com/oevangelhodecristo/), so I had one last task for the LLM. Translating everything to english. Again, it did so without breaking a sweat!

I'm mind blown. The productivity impact of this kind of tools is something we are now just beggining to grasp.
This was the first time I ever reached Chat GPT or Claude.ai free limits. I'm seriously considering buying a premium subscription.
