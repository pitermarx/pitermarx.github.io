  When the day is done
  Down to earth then sinks the sun
  Along with everything that was lost and won
  When the day is done.

  When the day is done
  Hope so much your race will be all run
  Then you find you jumped the gun
  Have to go back where you began
  When the day is done.

  When the night is cold
  Some get by but some get old
  Just to show lifes not made of gold
  When the night is cold.

  When the bird has flown
  Got no-one to call your own
  Got no place to call your home
  When the bird has flown.

  When the games been fought
  You speed the ball across the court
  Lost much sooner than you would have thought
  Now the games been fought.

  When the partys through
  Seems so very sad for you
  Didnt do the things you meant to do
  Now theres no time to start anew
  Now the partys through.

  When the day is done
  Down to earth then sinks the sun
  Along with everything that was lost and won
  When the day is done.
