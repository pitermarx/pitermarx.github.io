In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast alseep
You lie awake thinking of the girl
Never even think of counting sheep

While the whole wide world has learned it’s lesson
She’d be yours if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
Is the time i miss her most of all
