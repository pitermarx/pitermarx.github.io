> _“Hey I have this great idea for a new startup!  We’re going to launch an online dictionary.”_
> 
> What would be your first though? _“Yeah right buddy. Good luck with that.” or “You know that might work.”_
> 
> Wordnik proves that even the most crowded ideas still have massive room for improvement.  When you [look up a word on Wordnik](http://www.wordnik.com/words/craft) they will return definitions from multiple sources, example usage from literature and news, etymology, related words (_synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, same context, reverse dictionary, tags_), tweets using the word, visuals and sound pronunciations.
> 
> For the devs out there they have a [massive API](http://developer.wordnik.com/) and code library and [active Github repositories](https://github.com/wordnik)
