If you’ve seen Police Academy, you know of Michael Winslow’s talents. He played [Cadet Larvell Jones](http://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&q=Cadet+Larvell+Jones&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1269&bih=1079) and wowed the world with his vocal impersonations.

Come to think of it, I’m pretty sure Winslow gave me my first demonstration of the capabilities of a beat boxer. Fitting that he now makes a reapperance in the most impressive beat boxing performance I’ve ever seen.
