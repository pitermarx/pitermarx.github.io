<pre>
  Tell her not to go 
  I ain’t holding on no more 
  Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to time 

  Tell her not to cry 
  I just got scared that’s all 
  Tell her I’ll be by her side, all she has to do is call

  Tell her the chips are down 
  I drank too much and shouted it aloud 
  Tell her something in my heart 
  Needs her more than even clowns need the laughter of the crowd 

  Tell her what was wrong 
  I sometimes think to much but say nothing at all 
  And tell her from this high terrain, I am ready now to fall, i am ready now to fall 

  Tell her not to go 
  I ain’t holding on no more 
  Tell her nothing if not this; all I want to do is kiss her 

  Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to time.
