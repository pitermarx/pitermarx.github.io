<pre>
  We sailed away on a winter's day
  With fate as malleable as clay
  But ships are fallible, I say
  And the nautical, like all things, fades
  And I can recall our caravel:
  A little wicker beetle shell
  With four fine mastes and eightteen sails
  Its bearings on Cair Paravel

  O my love
  O it was a funny little thing
  To be the ones to've seen

  The sight of bridges and balloons
  Makes calm canaries irritable;
  They caw and claw all afternoon:
  "Catenaries and dirigibles
  Brace and buoy the living-room—
  A loom of metal, warp—woof—wimble"
  And a thimbles worth of milky moon
  Can touch hearts larger than a thimble

  O my love
  O it was a funny little thing
  To be the ones to've seen
</pre>
