  Looking back over my shoulder
  I can see that look in your eye
  I never dreamed it could be over
  I never wanted to say goodbye

  Looking back over my shoulder
  With an aching deep in my heart
  I wish that we were starting over
  Oh instead of drifting so far apart

  Everybody told me you were leaving
  Funny I should be the last to know
  Baby please tell me that I’m dreaming
  I just never want to let you go

  Looking back over my shoulder
  I can see that look in your eye
  Turning my heart over and over
  I never wanted to say goodbye

  I don’t mind everybody laughing
  But it’s enough to make a grown man cry
  Cos I can feel you slipping through my fingers
  I don’t even know the reason why

  Every day it’s a losing battle
  Just to smile and hold my head up high
  Could it be that we belong together
  Baby won’t you give me one more try
  One more try

  Looking back over my shoulder
  I can see that look in your eye
  I never dreamed it could be over
  I never wanted to say goodbye

  Looking back over my shoulder
  Oh with an aching feeling inside
  Cutting me up, deeper and deeper
  Fills me with a sadness that I can’t hide
