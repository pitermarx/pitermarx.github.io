  I used to know a little square so long ago, when I was small
  All summer long it had a fair, wonderful fair with swings and all
  I used to love my little fair and at the close of everyday

  I could be found, dancing around a merry-go-round that used to play…

  “Ah, mon amour
  A toi toujours
  Dans tes grands yeux
  Rien que nous deux”

  All summer long my little fair made everyday like a holiday
  Night after night it used to play and people came there from so far away
  And everyone sang that little tune all around town you heard it played

  Even Pepi from Napoli he sang to Marie this serenade…

  “Ah, mon amour
  A toi toujours
  Dans tes grands yeux
  Rien que nous deux”

  I can’t forget my little square even though I’m so far away
  I can’t forget my little fair. Maybe it’s still there, still there today
  I sometimes hear that little tune playing in a dream of long ago

  And in my brain runs the refrain. That old French refrain I used to know…

  “Ah, mon amour
  A toi toujours
  Dans tes grands yeux
  Rien que nous deux”
