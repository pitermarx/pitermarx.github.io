  I never knew I was a lover, just cause I steal the things you hide,
  Just cause I focus while we’re dancing, just cause I offered you a ride.
  Still I am not from Barcelona, I am not even from Madrid.
  I am a native of the North Pole and that can mess up any kid.

  Well if you could reinvent my name, well if you could redirect my day, 
  I wanna be the King of Spain. 

  And I will settle in Pamplona and I’ll provoke the bulls with words
  And then I’ll send a man to meet them all but blood is fake, so I have heard.
  And all the senoritas sighing, will be the fountain of my lies.
  But while we’re floating in siestas you search for bottles and for knives.

  Well if you could reinvent my name, well if you could redirect my day,
  I wanna be the King of Spain.

  And I wear my boots of Spanish leather oh while I’m tightening my crown.
  I’ll disappear in some flamenco perhaps I’ll reach the other side.
  Why are you stamping my illusion, just cause I stole some eagle’s wings?
  Because you named me as your lover, well, I thought I could be anything.

  Well if you could reinvent my name, well if you could redirect my day,
  I wanna be the King of Spain.
