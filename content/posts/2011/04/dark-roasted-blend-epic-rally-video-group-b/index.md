“Group B” was the most exciting and the most dangerous sort of rallying: with 600 hps supercars roaring through country lanes and narrow city streets, these monster machines were dubbed “Too Fast To Race” (see [documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv5Jto1Zdd4)) and banned back in 1986. This stunning slow-motion video pays homage to these legendary cars and almost superhuman drivers who made history from 1982 to 1986… check out the crazy crowd near-miss at [4:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFRhxsLfj-I#t=4m26s)
