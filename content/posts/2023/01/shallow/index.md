<pre>
 Tell me something, girl
 Are you happy in this modern world?
 Or do you need more?
 Is there something else you’re searching for?

 I’m falling
 In all the good times
 I find myself longing for change
 And in the bad times, I fear myself

 Tell me something, boy
 Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void?
 Or do you need more?
 Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore?

 I’m falling
 In all the good times
 I find myself longing for change
 And in the bad times, I fear myself

 I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
 I’ll never meet the ground
 Crash through the surface
 Where they can’t hurt us
 We’re far from the shallow now

 In the shallow, shallow
 In the shallow, shallow
 In the shallow, shallow
 We’re far from the shallow now

 I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
 I’ll never meet the ground
 Crash through the surface
 Where they can’t hurt us
 We’re far from the shallow now

 In the shallow, shallow
 In the shallow, shallow
 In the shallow, shallow
 We’re far from the shallow now
