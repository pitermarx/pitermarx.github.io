![](tablet.png "[How did the Babylonians know âˆš2 up to six digits?](https://thepalindrome.substack.com/p/how-did-the-babylonians-know-2-up)")

This clay tablet from 1800-1600 BC shows that ancient Babylonians were able to approximate the square root of two with 99.9999% precision.
These are numbers, written in Babylonian cuneiform numerals. They read as 1, 24, 51, and 10.

$$
 \sqrt{2} \approx \frac{1}{60^0}+\frac{24}{60^1}+\frac{51}{60^2}+\frac{10}{60^3} = 1.41421296296
$$

The margin of error here is less than \\(6 \times 10^7\\)
