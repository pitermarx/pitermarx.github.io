  How many times have you heard someone say
  If I had money, I would do things my way
  But little they know that it's so hard to find
  One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
  Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old
  A friend, when you're lonely, or peace to your soul
  The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
  Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

  When my life is over and my time has run out
  My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
  But, one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
  I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
  One thing's for certain, when it comes my time
  I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
  Satisfied mind
