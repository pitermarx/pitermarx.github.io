> Love of truth is not enough.
> If truth does not somehow rebound on you and love you back, 
> if truth is only an abstraction and not a person, 
> you have theology but not religion.
> Theology is a one way relationship. Theology is a science.
> Religion is a two way relationship.
> God's initiative comes first and our response comes second.
