This year I didn't find yet [another version](/2024/12/my-favourite-christmas-carol-v4/) of [my favourite](/2020/12/my-favourite-christmas-carol) [christmas](/2021/12/my-favourite-christmas-carol-v2) [carol](/2023/12/my-favourite-christmas-carol-v3), but this version of a 1872 poem called [In the Bleak Midwinter](https://justapedia.org/wiki/In_the_Bleak_Midwinter) is pretty great!!

<pre>
In the bleak mid-winter
Frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid-winter
Long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him
Nor earth sustain,
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign:
In the bleak mid-winter
A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty —
Jesus Christ.	

Enough for Him, whom cherubim
Worship night and day,
A breastful of milk
And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom Angels
Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
Which adore.

Angels and Archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air;
But only His Mother
In her maiden bliss
Worshipped the Beloved
With a kiss.

What can I give Him,
Poor as I am? —
If I were a Shepherd
I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man
I would do my part, —
Yet what I can I give Him, —
Give my heart.
