(Translated by AI from the [PT version](/pt/2025/12/jesus-chorou))
<pre>
For Lazarus, Jesus wept.
They said, “See how He loved him so.”
The Lord of Life looked up to heaven,
to His Father said, “I give You thanks,”
then cried aloud: “Come forth, come out!” —
and death fled swiftly from its hold.

In Gethsemane, Jesus wept.
Blood and sweat, deep agony.
The bitter cup the Father gave
He drank, He died — yet on the third day
the stone was rolled, He rose again,
and empty stood the silent grave.

Jesus wept for Jerusalem,
the city that its prophets slays.
Do you not see? Your King draws near!
You shall not see the Saviour’s face
until you cry: “Blessed is He
who comes in the Lord’s own Name.”

Lazarus rose; Jesus lives!
The mighty King shall reign in Zion!
All the saints shall rise again,
death shall no longer rule nor reign,
and every tear God will wipe away —
even those once shed by Christ Himself.
</pre>
The AI song is pretty good too
