Why do we say "Happy Easter"? What's so happy about it? We are supposedly celebrating the death of Christ, who died one of the most undeserving and painful deaths anyone could.

The happiness is not on the death itself but rather on the effects that it has. Christians believe that Jesus' death is a substitutionary payment for our sins ({{< biblink "Isa 53:5" "NIV" >}}), it's a ransom from the power of death ({{< biblink "Heb 2:15" "NIV" >}}) and it brings peace with God ({{< biblink "Rom 5:10" "NIV" >}}).

This is great news, but how do we know that this is true? How do we differentiate wishful thinking from reality? This question brings me to the point of this article.

# Minimal facts

A couple of days ago I watched [this short youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxgB7ro4QQA) where a scholar who has dedicated his career to investigating the resurrection makes his case. He calls it the "minimal facts" approach. This argument doesn’t assume the Bible is inerrant; instead, it focuses only on historical facts that even skeptical scholars accept. The result? A case that’s hard to dismiss.

I used deepseek (a chinese AI) to take the transcription and make a summary of the points. The transcript of the conversation can be seen in this [PDF document](deepseek.pdf)

## 1. Jesus Died by Crucifixion

This fact is as solid as any in ancient history. Roman and Jewish sources (like Tacitus and Josephus) confirm Jesus’ execution. Even atheist scholars (Bart Ehrman, John Dominic Crossan) agree—crucifixion was a brutal, public, and undeniable death. Without Jesus’ death, resurrection is impossible. So this is where the case begins. Why does this matter? If Jesus didn’t really die, the resurrection claim collapses. But the evidence is overwhelming: He did die.

## 2. The Disciples Believed They Saw the Risen Jesus

The disciples didn’t just claim Jesus appeared to them — they staked their lives on it. Multiple individual and group sightings are recorded ({{< biblink "1 Cor 15:5-8" >}} mentions appearances to Peter, the Twelve, and even 500 people at once). Even skeptical historians admit the disciples genuinely believed they encountered the risen Jesus. Gerd Lüdemann, an atheist scholar, argues they had "visions," but he doesn’t deny their sincerity. These weren’t gullible peasants. They were hardened skeptics at first ({{< biblink "Luk 24:11" >}}) — yet became utterly convinced. What could make a group of frightened, disillusioned men suddenly risk everything to proclaim a resurrected Messiah?

## 3. Their Lives Were Radically Transformed

These men didn’t just preach the resurrection—they lived and died for it.

Peter, who denied Jesus out of fear, later stood before the same authorities and declared, "We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard" ({{< biblink "Acts 4:20" >}}).

James, Jesus’ brother, went from skeptic ({{< biblink "John 7:5" >}}) to martyr (Josephus records his execution in AD 62). James wasn’t just any skeptic—he was Jesus’ own brother, who didn’t believe in Him during His ministry ({{< biblink "Mark 3:21" >}}).
Yet after the crucifixion, James became a leader in the Jerusalem church ({{< biblink "Acts 15" >}}).

Paul, a violent persecutor of Christians, became Christianity’s greatest missionary—enduring beatings, imprisonment, and eventual execution. He hated Christians, arresting and approving their executions ({{< biblink "Acts 8:1-3" >}}).
Yet after claiming to see the risen Jesus (Acts 9), he became Christianity’s most passionate missionary.

People die for what they believe is true—but not for what they know is a lie. If the resurrection was fabricated, why would the disciples die for it?

## 4. The Resurrection Was Preached Immediately

One of the strongest arguments for the resurrection is how early it was proclaimed.
{{< biblink "1 Corinthians 15:3-7" >}} contains an ancient creed that scholars date to within 1-5 years of the crucifixion.
Acts 2 records Peter preaching the resurrection at Pentecost—just 50 days after the crucifixion.
I have previously written about the [New Testament creeds](/2022/04/the-new-testament-creeds/), passages that have a different wording than the rest of the surrounding text. They are creedal formulations , constructed in a way that helps recitation and memorization. In them we understand that the first Christians immediately after Jesus' death affirmed his divinity, pre-existence, death for our sins, burial and resurrection.

There was no time for legend to develop. The message was public and immediate. If the resurrection were a myth, we’d expect it to emerge decades later (like other legendary accounts). But it was proclaimed right away—when eyewitnesses were still alive to confirm or deny it.


# What’s the Best Explanation?

Every alternative theory—hallucinations, conspiracy, legend—fails to explain all six facts.

Hallucinations? They don’t happen to groups of people at once.

Conspiracy? People don’t die for lies they invented.

Legend? The resurrection was preached far too early for myth to develop.

The only explanation that fits all the evidence is the one the disciples gave: Jesus rose from the dead.

## What Does This Mean for You?

If Jesus really rose:

* He is who He claimed to be—God in the flesh.
* His promises are true—forgiveness, eternal life, and purpose.

Your response matters—not just intellectual agreement, but surrender.

As C.S. Lewis put it:

> Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important.
