## People of the Book

The Qur’an frequently refers to the “People of the Book” — Jews and Christians, recipients of earlier revelation. These scriptures are not rejected but affirmed. The Torah (_Tawrat_) and the Gospel (_Injil_) are called divine books given to previous communities:

> _“He has sent down upon you the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Criterion. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allāh will have a severe punishment, and Allāh is Exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution"_
> — <cite>[Quran 3:3-4](https://quran.com/3/3-4)</cite>

> _“But why do they come to you for judgment when they have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not believers. Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. [...] And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.”_
> — <cite>[Quran 5:43,44,46](https://quran.com/5/44-46)</cite>

The Qur’an calls them _hudan wa nur_ — “guidance and light” — and affirms their continuity with itself (_musaddiqan lima bayna yadayhi_). Ibn Kathir, on Sura 3:3, writes that the Qur’an confirms the original truth of the Torah and Gospel[^1].

[^1]: [Ibn Kathir Tafsir](http://m.qtafsir.com/Surah-Aal-e-Imran/Chapter-3) (Confirming what came before it) means, from the previous divinely revealed Books, sent to the servants and Prophets of Allah. These Books testify to the truth of the Qur'an, and the Qur'an also testifies to the truth these Books contained

## The Sinlessness of Jesus

In the Qur’an, Jesus (‘Isa) is not only a prophet but unique in origin and character. At his birth, the angel announces:

> _“I am only a messenger of your Lord to announce to you the gift of a pure boy (_ghulāman zakiyyaa_).”_
> — <cite>[Quran 19:19](https://quran.com/19%3A19)</cite>

The word _zakiyyaa_ means morally pure. No other prophet is described this way. In contrast, Muhammad is told to seek forgiveness ([Sura 47:19](https://quran.com/47:19)), Adam repents ([Sura 2:37](https://quran.com/2:37)), and Moses confesses error ([Sura 28:16](https://quran.com/28:16)). Jesus alone is never shown repenting or being corrected. [Al-Tabari agrees](https://e-quran.com/pages/tafseer/tabary/19/19.html): it means one who is pure and righteous; free from sin. Jesus is also born of a virgin ([Sura 19:20–21](https://quran.com/19/20-21)) and performs miracles by God’s permission ([Sura 3:49](https://quran.com/3:49)).

The New Testament agrees. Pilate says, _“I find no fault in this man”_ ([Luke 23:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23%3A4&version=NIV)). Jesus asks, _“Which of you convicts me of sin?”_ ([John 8:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A46&version=NIV)), and receives no answer. In both scriptures, Jesus is sinless.

## The Law of Burden

The Qur’an teaches that guilt is not transferable:

> _“No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”_
> — <cite>[Quran 6:164](https://quran.com/6:164)</cite>

> _“Whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for his own soul.”_
> — <cite>[Quran 35:18](https://quran.com/35:18)</cite>

Each soul is accountable for itself. [Ibn Kathir writes](http://m.qtafsir.com/Surah-Al-Anaam/Every-Person-Carries-His-Own-B---): “every person will be tied to his evil deeds”. This excludes all from bearing another’s guilt — except one who has none.

Only Jesus, described as _zakiyyaa_, is without sin. If guilt disqualifies, and Jesus is innocent, then only he could — in principle — bear another’s burden.

## The Christian Claim

The Christian gospel draws this conclusion. God’s justice requires the punishment of sin; God’s mercy seeks forgiveness. The solution is not injustice, but substitution:

> _“Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.”_
> — <cite>[Hebrews 9:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A22&version=NIV)</cite>

> _“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.”_
> — <cite>[2 Corinthians 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A21&version=NIV)</cite>

Jesus, the sinless one, bears the guilt of others — not by violating the law, but by fulfilling it. His death is the offering of the innocent in place of the guilty.

If the Qur’an affirms Jesus’ sinlessness, and insists that only the sinless can bear another’s burden, then the Christian doctrine of atonement is not foreign to its logic. It is simply an unexpected conclusion.

## The Crucifixion

The Qur’an says:

> _“They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but another was made to resemble him... Rather, Allah raised him to Himself.”_
> — <cite>[Quran 4:157–158](https://quran.com/4/157-158)</cite>

Traditional commentators suggest that someone else was crucified instead of Jesus. But this raises problems: it implies divine deception and punishes the wrong person, contrary to Qur’anic justice.

Historical records confirm the crucifixion. [Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus), writing around 93 CE, mentions Jesus’ execution. Early Christian, Jewish, and [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus_on_Jesus) sources agree.

Some modern scholars, like [Mahmoud Ayoub](http://religionatthemargins.com/2011/07/never-say-die-the-death-of-jesus-in-the-quran/), interpret the passage differently. They suggest the denial is not of the event but of its meaning: Jesus’ enemies did not defeat him. “They did not kill him” may mean they did not succeed. God raised him — a vindication, not an escape. This avoids the charge of deception and fits the Qur’an’s portrayal of Jesus.

## An Invitation

Who is this figure — called Messiah, Word of God, Spirit from Him ([Sura 4:171](https://quran.com/4:171))? Born of a virgin, without sin, exalted to God?

The Gospel says: through him, through his death and resurrection God made a way.

Justice is fulfilled. Mercy is given.

Could it be true?
