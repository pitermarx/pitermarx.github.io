This morning, I finished C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia. What an incredible set of books! Lewis remains undefeated as my favorite author, and the journey through Narnia has left me awestruck.

I find myself at a loss for words to fully describe how much I love these stories. The final book, The Last Battle, especially moved me, leaving me with a profound sense of awe I hadn’t felt in a long time. Lewis’s depiction of the end of the world and the transition to something greater is deeply evocative. One line, in particular, has taken root in my mind:

> The inside is bigger than the outside.

It’s a reminder that the world God has created, with all its awe-inspiring beauty, is merely a hint of what awaits us in the new heavens and new earth promised to those who trust in Him.

Lewis’s cry, _"Narnia, Narnia, Narnia! Awake. Love. Think. Speak."_ feels like a rallying call to live awake to that greater reality. Yet, I stumble when I try to picture what awaits us — colors unseen, melodies unheard, pleasures untainted. But the limitation is mine, not reality’s. Lewis, though, bridges the gap. His stories don’t just entertain; they train my soul to yearn.

One realization I’ve had is how much easier it seems to illustrate evil compared to beauty and goodness ({{< biblink "Gen 6:6" "NIV" >}}). It takes an extraordinary imagination to portray the richness of God and the goodness of His creation.

But Lewis inspires us to dream of a world where goodness, truth, and beauty reign supreme. Through Narnia, he invites us to wake up, love, think, and speak—to imagine and anticipate the unimaginable glory that lies ahead. For that, I’m deeply grateful.

Come further up, come further in! Toward the Lion’s country!
