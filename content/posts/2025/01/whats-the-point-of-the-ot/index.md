## Introduction

A friend reading the Bible for the first time challenged me with a simple question: "What's the point of the Old Testament?"

From his perspective, Jesus and Christianity established a new religion with new scriptures. If Christians have the Gospels (accounts of Jesus' life) and the New Testament (doctrinal letters), what role does the Old Testament play? Hasn't it been superseded? What value lies in a Bible containing both Old and New Testaments? Why do Christians still read it?

This question highlights a common misconception, partly fueled by the term "Old Testament" itself. Calling it "Old" and having a "New" Testament suggests the first part of the Bible is outdated. I prefer the Jewish term "Tanakh," an acronym for the three sections of Jewish scriptures. However, for familiarity, let's stick with "Old Testament."

There are multiple ways to address this question, but I'll focus on one key point: the entire Bible, both Old and New Testaments, forms a coherent collection of books with an overarching narrative. The Christian Bible isn't a document written by a committee to consolidate doctrines. Rather, it's a compilation of texts written over centuries by various authors in different languages. Christians (and Jews) merely recognized these writings as "inspired" or "revealed" by God and compiled them into a single volume.

This overarching narrative spanning the entire Bible tells us what's wrong with the world and how God's providence is addressing it. It's a story from creation to fall, and from fall to glory — from Eden to the desert, and from the desert to the New Jerusalem.

Most New Testament writers were Jews, as was Jesus himself. They read, studied, and believed the Jewish scriptures (the Christian Old Testament if we want to simplify). The Gospels recount the life of Jesus, the Jewish Messiah, his words, and deeds. The letters to the churches explain how Christians should think and behave in light of this Messiah. The Bible concludes with the book of Revelation, a series of visions given to the apostle John, revealing the end of the age and how the Messiah will bring it about.

Christianity isn't a new religion. It's a Jewish apocalyptic message taken to its logical conclusions, considering the death and resurrection of the Messiah. Christians are, in fact, a Jewish sect with two distinctive beliefs:

1\. The Messiah has already come: Jesus of Nazareth. He died for the world's sins, rose from the grave, and will return to establish his kingdom.

2\. Gentiles (non-Jews) can join this kingdom through allegiance to King Jesus.

To understand this "Jewish-Apocalyptic" message, let's briefly survey the whole Bible, tracking it through the Tanakh and the New Testament.

Before we proceed, let me clarify what I mean by "Apocalyptic". This term refers to a view of History divided in half by a major event, "The Apocalypse". It's a perspective that sees any event other than the transition from this age into the next as secondary. Discovery of writing? Secondary. Invention of mathematics? Secondary. Landing on the Moon? Secondary. The only events that truly matter are those ushering in the end of the age. By "Jewish-Apocalyptic," I mean the end of the age should be understood as presented in the Jewish Scriptures.

## Beginnings

In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, everything was very good ({{< biblink "Gen 1:31" "NIV" >}}). There was no sin, and God lived among his creation ({{< biblink "Gen 3:8" "NIV" >}}).

Deceived by the serpent, the first couple disobeyed God ({{< biblink "Gen 3:6" "NIV" >}}). Sin entered the world, bringing pain and death ({{< biblink "Gen 3:19" "NIV" >}}). Mankind was expelled from the garden, losing access to the tree of life and God ({{< biblink "Gen 3:23" "NIV" >}}). This is called "The Fall". Mankind was cursed to suffer and die.

Even so, God made a promise to the serpent. A promise of hope of a savior for mankind, a _seed_ from the woman, a man (with a heel) that would once and for all "crush the head" of the serpent.

{{< bible "Gen 3:15" "NKJV" >}}
And I will put enmity
Between you and the woman,
And between your seed and **_her Seed_**;
He shall bruise your head,
And you shall bruise His heel.
{{< /bible >}}

The effects of the fall were felt hard in this first family. Cain, the first son of Adam and Eve, murdered his brother ({{< biblink "Gen 4:8" "NIV" >}}). Man was now mortal ({{< biblink "Genesis 5" "NIV" >}}) and evil was in his heart all the time ({{< biblink "Gen 6:5" "NIV" >}}), so God decided to wipe the human race from the face of the earth ({{< biblink "Gen 6:13" "NIV" >}}).

Despite the looming threat, God made provisions to keep his promise that one day a man, a _seed_ from the woman, would put an end to evil. So **He chose** Noah to build an ark to save mankind from judgement ({{< biblink "Gen 6:18" "NIV" >}}).

After the flood, God made a promise to never again destroy the world with water ({{< biblink "Gen 8:21" "NIV" >}}), and ordered Noah and his descendants to multiply and fill the earth ({{< biblink "Gen 9:1" "NIV" >}}). Mankind rebelled and decided to "make a name" for themselves ({{< biblink "Gen 11:4" "NIV" >}}), instead of following God's instructions, but this time God intervened and forced them to spread over the land.

Scriptures tell us how history began: God creates, man rebels, and a war between God's plans and humanity's evil intentions begins. Even from this early point we see that there is an "Apocalyptic" expectation. There will be a **_day_** when the promised **_seed_** will end evil and restore mankind to the Garden. God promises to end evil **_through_** mankind, and even amidst the flood, God kept his word by **_choosing_** Noah as the carrier of the promised seed line, and now God will **_choose_** again.

## From Abraham to Moses

Abraham is a unique figure in the Bible. He is promised again and again that he will be a great nation, be a blessing to all people ({{< biblink "Gen 12:2-3" "NIV" >}}) and receive land ({{< biblink "Gen 15:18" "NIV" >}}) for his **_seed_** ({{< biblink "Gen 13:15" "NIV" >}}), which would be as countless as the stars ({{< biblink "Gen 15:5" "NIV" >}}). God makes an "everlasting covenant" ({{< biblink "Gen 17:7" "NIV" >}}).

God's plans to end evil and reverse the curse through the ***seed of the woman*** are now gaining focus on a man and his family. It is through Abraham that God is going to bless all nations ({{< biblink "Gen 22:17-18" "NIV" >}}) and blessings that will overflow to everyone.

Jacob and his twelve sons end up in Egypt, where the last patriarch dies. Just before his death, he blesses each one of his sons, making prophetic statements about each one. The prophecy about Judah is hard to interpret, but there is some agreement between the Christian and the Jewish tradition that the following sentence refers to the Messiah. Let's focus in on it.

{{< bible "Gen 49:10" "NKJV" >}}
The scepter will not depart from Judah,

nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,

until he to whom it belongs shall come

and the obedience of the nations shall be his.

{{< /bible >}}

Jacob says about Judah that he will rule over his brothers. It's in Judah that the true royal dynasty of Israel will be found. But this prophecy extends beyond a mere local kingdom. One day, the one to whom the scepter truly belongs will come, and all nations will obey him. The lens of biblical witness is now focusing again, narrowing the origin of the ***seed*** in Judah. This Savior is a king that will not only end evil and reverse the curse, but also rule over the nations.

Centuries pass, and now the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are enslaved in Egypt. God sends a man to free them, Moses, but this is not yet the promised king. Moses delivered Israel from Egypt, but he died before any of the promises to the Patriarchs were fulfilled. Suffering and death were still cursing mankind. The King-Messiah was to come from Judah ({{< biblink "Num 24:17" "NIV" >}}), and the people of Israel were still waiting for him.

## Shadows of the Messiah

After Moses led the people out of Egypt, he warned them that they would need another prophet like him in the future ({{< biblink "Deut 18:15" "NIV" >}}). The promised seed would need to be a greater conqueror, one who could achieve a complete and lasting victory.

When Joshua died, Israel forsook God and served other gods ({{< biblink "Judges 2:12" "NIV" >}}), without a King-Messiah who could lead them in God's ways.

Then came David, a shepherd boy from Bethlehem, from the tribe of Judah. God ***chose*** him to be king over Israel, and made him an astounding promise. Not only would David's son build God's house, but God would establish David's house forever:

> When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors,
> **I will** raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood,
> and **I will** establish his kingdom.
> He is the one who will build a house for my Name,
> and **I will** establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
> **I will** be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands.But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
> Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me;
> ***Your throne will be established forever***.
> - 2 Sam 7:12-16

The lens of biblical witness now focused even more sharply: the promised seed would come from David's line and his kingdom would never end. The promise to David became Israel's great hope. Even when David's descendants failed and the kingdom split, even when foreign nations conquered them and sent them into exile, the people clung to God's promise. Through the prophets, God kept reminding them: a son of David would come, and his kingdom would never end.

## The Prophetic witness

Entire libraries could be written about how the rest of the Tanach points to the "Son of David" as the Messiah that would deliver Israel, reverse the curse, and establish an everlasting kingdom. Let's just reference a few passages.

### Ezekiel 37:24-28

> My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees. They will live ***in the land*** I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where your ancestors lived. They and their children and their children’s children ***will live there forever***, and David my servant will be their prince forever. I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them forever. ***My dwelling place will be with them***; I will be their God, and they will be my people. Then the nations will know that I the Lord make Israel holy, when my sanctuary is among them forever

The promise of a king from the line of David is tied to the promise of the land to the Patriarchs. In addition to this, just like it was in Eden, God will live among his people.

### Jeremiah 23:5-6

> “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.

> In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Savior."

This King, will "save Judah" and make Israel to live in safety. This points to the idea that there will be persecution and danger to God's people until the end.

### Daniel 7:13-14

>  In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and ***his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed***.

This "son of man" receives an everlasting kingdom, authority, glory and worship from all nations. His authority comes directly from God - the Ancient of Days.

### Hosea 3:4-5

>   For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and ***David their king***. They will come trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the last days.

Israel will come to their King "in the last days", after a prolonged time without rulers and sacrifice.

### Isaiah 9:6-7

>  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.

>  He will reign on ***David’s throne*** and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and ***forever***.

>  The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.

The ***seed*** promised in genesis is a human. It's a child, but with many amazing titles. He will be an eternal King that will sit on David's throne.

### Isaiah 11:10-11

>  In that day the ***Root of Jesse*** will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the surviving remnant of his people

Jesse is the father of David, and the Root of Jesse is the King-Messiah to whom all nations will rally.

The book of Isaiah is particularly rich on prophecies about the last days and the coming of the messiah, written in the 8th century BCE. It is amazing that since 1946, with the discovery of the dead sea scrolls. we have a physical copy of this book dating from over 2000 years ago.

## The day of the Lord

From our brief survey of the Tanakh, we've established that the Jewish hope was a Messiah figure, a king. He would be the seed of the woman, the prophet like Moses, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Judah, a Son of David. Promises were made through the prophets again and again that the day would come where this king would come. The prophets also gave some details about that day: The Day of the Lord.

### Isaiah 2:12,17-19

>  The Lord Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled)... The arrogance of man will be brought low and human pride humbled; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day, and the idols will totally disappear. People will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from the fearful presence of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.

The Day of the Lord is a time of judgment on pride and exaltation of God.

### Isaiah 13:6-13

>  Wail, for the day of the Lord is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty... See, the day of the Lord is coming —a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger— to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light... Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the Lord Almighty, in the day of his burning anger

The Day of the Lord is a time of cosmic upheaval and divine wrath.

### Ezekiel 30:2-3

>  Son of man, prophesy and say: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Wail and say, "Alas for that day!" For the day is near, the day of the Lord is near— a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.

The Day of the Lord is a time of judgment on nations.

### Joel 2:1-2,11,30-32

>  Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming. It is close at hand— a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness... The day of the Lord is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it? ...

>  I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved

The Day of the Lord is coming and it's close at hand! While it has terrible cosmic signs, it also offers hope of salvation.

### Joel 3:14-16

>  Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine. The Lord will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the Lord will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel

In the Day of the Lord there will be protection for God's people.

### Amos 5:18-20

>  Woe to you who long for the day of the Lord! Why do you long for the day of the Lord? That day will be darkness, not light. It will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear, as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him. Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light— pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?

The prophet Amos warns against misunderstanding the nature of the Day of the Lord, emphasizing its judgment aspect.

### Zephaniah 1:14-16

>  The great day of the Lord is near— near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the Lord is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry. That day will be a day of wrath — a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness — a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.

This brief survey does not cover at all the full breadth of information about the Day that the prophets bring. But it makes it clear that this is part of the hope of the Jews. This is the Apocalyptic nature of that hope. The way that God has setup to bring about the messianic age is through the "Day of the Lord", when he will pour judgement over the nations, and deliver his people from oppression.

## The Gospel of the Kingdom

We now need to tackle the question of how did the first followers of Jesus understand his message, his mission and his identity. They were Jews, with the Messianic Apocalyptic hope that we just laid out. How did they portray Jesus in the books they left us?

The opening of the first book of the New Testament leaves room for no doubts. This is a Jewish book, written to a Jewish audience, who is waiting for the Messiah.

>  This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David, the son of Abraham

>  - Mathew 1:1

When the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would miraculously give birth, the identity of her son was very clear. This would be the promised seed. This would be the Davidic King. This would be the Messiah

>  Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.

>  - Luke 1:30-33

The Gospels paint a vivid picture of a Jewish hope fulfilled: the coming of the Messiah and the kingdom of God. Jesus’ ministry continually emphasizes the nearness of this kingdom. From the opening of Mark's Gospel, Jesus declares:

>  “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”

>  — Mark 1:15

This kingdom hope aligns with the promises of the Old Testament. Jesus, born in Bethlehem, is presented as the descendant of David, fulfilling the Messianic prophecies (Luke 2:4-11). His genealogy in both Matthew and Luke underscores his connection to Abraham and David, anchoring him as the promised seed.

The hope of a restored Jewish kingdom was central to Jesus' message. Jesus’ miracles—healing the sick, casting out demons, and raising the dead — were not just acts of compassion but signs that the Messianic age had begun (Isaiah 35:5-6, Matthew 11:4-5).

Even in his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Jesus fulfills the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9, entering the city as a humble king. The crowds proclaim him the "Son of David," acknowledging their hope that he would bring the long-awaited kingdom.

## The Second Coming and the Day of the Lord

The religious leaders of Jesus' time rejected his message and authority. This rejection led to his crucifixion, shattering the disciples' Messianic hopes. However, three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, vindicating his Messianic claims. He ascended to heaven, but promised his disciples he would return, transforming their understanding of the kingdom's arrival into a two-stage event: His first coming to deal with sin through His death and resurrection, and a future day when He would return to establish his kingdom.

Jesus taught about the Day of the Lord, a time of final judgment and restoration that aligns with the apocalyptic visions of the prophets. In Matthew 24-25, He speaks extensively about this future day. He warns of wars, natural disasters, and persecution, all precursors to His return. He describes his coming as sudden and visible, like lightning flashing across the sky (Matthew 24:27). The imagery mirrors Old Testament depictions of cosmic upheaval and divine intervention (Joel 2:30-32).

The book of Revelation expands on this vision, portraying Jesus as the victorious warrior and the conquering King who will judge the nations and inaugurate the New Jerusalem. This finally fulfills the hope expressed in the prophets: an eternal kingdom where God dwells with his people, and the curse of sin is reversed.

## Conclusion: Jesus' Self-Understanding in Luke 4:16-20

In Luke 4:16-20, Jesus reveals his identity and mission with profound clarity. Reading from Isaiah 61, he declares:

>  “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”

After reading, he boldly announces, _“Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”_

This moment encapsulates Jesus' self-understanding as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. He sees himself as the anointed one, the Messiah, inaugurating the long-awaited kingdom. Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection demonstrate his role as the promised seed who crushes the serpent's head, reversing the curse of the Fall. In his first coming, he fulfilled the role of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53), bringing salvation to humanity.

It is very interesting to note what Jesus did not read in Isaiah 61:2.

>  ...to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and **the day of vengeance of our God**

In his second coming, he will return as the conquering King, completing the restoration of all things, eradicating all evil from the earth. There is still time to become part of his kingdom. Repent from your sins and trust in Jesus as Lord!

The Bible’s narrative, from Genesis to Revelation, centers on Jesus. He is the seed of the woman, the Son of David, and the Son of God. The Old and New Testaments together reveal the unfolding story of God’s plan, culminating in Jesus' reign. Through him, the Jewish hope for a Messiah, the Christian expectation for the second coming, and the apocalyptic vision of the Day of the Lord find their ultimate realization.
