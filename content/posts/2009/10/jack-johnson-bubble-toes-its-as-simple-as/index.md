    It’s as simple as something that nobody knows that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
    on the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards and her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
    It’s as common as something that nobody knows that her beauty will follow wherever she goes
    up the hill in the back of her house in the would she love me forever, I know she could

    I remember when you and me mmm how we used to be just good friends
    Wouldn’t give me none but all I wanted was some

    She’s got a whole lot of reasons
    She cant think of a single one that can justify leaving
    And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
    Man he got, too much time to waste

    His dreams are like commercials
    But her dreams are picture perfect and
    Our dreams are so related though they’re often underestimated

    It’s as simple as something that nobody knows that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
    On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards and her feet are infested with tar balls and

    La da da da da da

    Well I was eating lunch at the D. L. G. when this little girl came and she sat next to me
    I never seen nobody move the way she did
    Well she did and she does and she’ll do it again

    When you move like a jellyfish
    Rhythm don’t mean nothing you go with the flow you don’t stop
    Move like a jellyfish
    Rhythm is nothing you go with the flow you don’t stop

    It’s as common as something that nobody knows
    Her beauty will follow wherever she goes
    Up the hill in the back of her house in the wood
    She’ll love me forever, I know she

    La da da da da da

    If you would only listen
    You might just realize what you’re missing
    You’re missing me
    (2X)

    It’s as simple as something that nobody knows that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
    On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards and her feet are infested with tar balls and

    La da da da da da
