<pre>
    I could show the world how to smile
    I could be glad all of the while
    I could turn the gray skies to blue
    If I had you

    I could leave my old days behind
    Leave all my pals and never mind
    There is nothing I couldn’t do
    If I had you

    I could climb a snow-capped mountain
    Sail the mighty ocean wide
    I could cross a burning desert
    If I had you by my side

    I could be a queen dear on ground
    Humble or poor
    Rich or renown
    There is nothing I couldn’t do
    If I had you
