**Kings of Convenience - Riot on an empty street - Know-How**

Riding on this know-how.  
Never been here before.  
Peculiarly entrusted,  
possibly that’s all.  
Is history recorded,  
does someone have a tape?  
Surely, I’m no pioneer,  
constellations stay the same.  
  
Just a little bit of danger,  
when intriguingly, our little secret,  
trusts that you trust me.  
‘Cause no one will ever know,  
that this was happening,  
so tell me why you listen,  
when nobody’s talking.  
  
What is there to know?  
All this is what it is.  
Oh… You and me alone,  
sheer simplicity…
