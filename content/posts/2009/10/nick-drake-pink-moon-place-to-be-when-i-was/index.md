<pre>
    When I was younger, younger than before
    I never saw the truth hanging from the door
    And now Im older see it face to face
    And now Im older gotta get up clean the place.

    And I was green, greener than the hill
    Where the flowers grew and the sun shone still
    Now Im darker than the deepest sea
    Just hand me down, give me a place to be.

    And I was strong, strong in the sun
    I thought Id see when day is done
    Now Im weaker than the palest blue
    Oh, so weak in this need for you.
