<pre>
  I was walking along mindin' my business
  When out of an orange colored sky
  Flash, Bam, Alakazam, wonderful you came by

  I was hummin' a tune, drinkin' in sunshine
  When out of that orange colored sky
  Wham, Bam, Alakazam, I got a look at you.

  One look and I yelled "timber". watch out for flying glass
  'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
  I went in to a spin and i started to shout
  "I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I've been hit"

  I was walkin' along mindin' my business
  When love came and hit me in the eye
  Flash, Bam, Alakazam, out of an orange colored sky
  Then came a Flash, a Bam, Alakazam, wonderful you came by
  Then came a Flash, Bam, Alakazam, I got a look at you.

  One look and I yelled "timber". watch out for flying glass
  'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
  I went in to a spin and i started to shout
  "I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I've been hit"

  I was walkin' along mindin' my business
  When love came and hit me in the eye
  Flash, Bam, Alakazam, out of an orange colored
  Purple, striped, pretty green polka-dot sky
  Flash, Bam, Alakazamâ€¦
  And goodbye
