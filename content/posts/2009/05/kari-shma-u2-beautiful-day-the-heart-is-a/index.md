  The heart is a bloom, shoots up through stony ground
  But there’s no room, no space to rent in this town
  You’re out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
  The traffic is stuck and you’re not moving anywhere.
  You thought you’d found a friend to take you out of this place
  Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

  It’s a beautiful day,
  the sky falls And you feel like
  it’s a beautiful day,
  Don’t let it get away

  You’re on the road but you’ve got no destination
  You’re in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
  You love this town even if that doesn’t ring true
  You’ve been all over and it’s been all over you

  It’s a beautiful day,
  Don’t let it get away
  It’s a beautiful day,

  Touch me, take me to that other place
  Teach me love, I know I’m not a hopeless case

  See the world in green and blue
  See China right in front of you
  See the canyons broken by cloud
  See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
  See the bedouin fires at night
  See the oil fields at first light
  See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
  After the flood all the colours came out

  It was a beautiful day
  Don’t let it get away
  A beautiful day

  Touch me, take me to that other place
  Reach me, I know I’m not a hopeless case

  What you don’t have you don’t need it now
  What you don’t know you can feel it somehow
  What you don’t have you don’t need it now
  You don’t need it now
