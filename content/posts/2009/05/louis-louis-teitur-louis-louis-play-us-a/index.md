  Louis, Louis
  Play us a song
  Louis, Louis
  This stage is aching for one
  Please come back to the quiet generation
  We don’t have any representation

  Louis, Louis
  Our stars no longer dance
  Louis, Louis
  Come down through the heavens
  The sky is full of innuendos
  We don’t want any heroes

  Louis, Louis
  All we want is music
  Louis, Louis
  You play it without melancholy

  Please play a song for everyone
  Play it like it was the only one
  So it will travel through the valleys
  Into the roses and the berries
  Louis, Louis
  Louis, Louis

  Louis, Louis
  They shot all the poets
  Louis, Louis
  The world is not like you know it
  There’s no one with the right agenda
  That’s why we stay down here and won’t surrender

  Louis, Louis
  When only music is the answer
  Louis, Louis
  Every living being is a dancer

  Please play a song for everyone
  Play it like it was the only one
  So it will travel through the valleys
  Into the roses and the berries

  So it will travel through the valleys
  Into the roses and the berries
  Louis, Louis
  Louis, Louis
  Louis, Louis
  Louis, Louis

  Play us a song
