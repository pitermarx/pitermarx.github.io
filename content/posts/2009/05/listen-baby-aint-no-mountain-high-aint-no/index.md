Listen, baby
Ain’t no mountain high, ain’t no vally low
Ain’t no river wide enough, baby
If you need me, call me.
No matter where you are, no matter how far
Just call my name, I’ll be there in a hurry You don’t have to worry
‘Cause baby,
There ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough
Ain’t no river wide enough, to keep me from getting to you
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on I made a vow
I’ll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
'Cause baby,
There ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough
Ain’t no river wide enough, to keep me from getting to you
No wind, no rain
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I’ll be there on the double, as fast as I can
Don’t you know that
There ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough
Ain’t no river wide enough, to keep me from getting to you
Don’t you know that
There ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough
Ain’t no river wide enough
