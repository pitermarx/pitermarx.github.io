**Explanation:** Our Sun may look like all soft and fluffy, but it’s not. [Our Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) is an extremely large ball of [bubbling hot gas](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970108.html), mostly [hydrogen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/1.html) gas. The [above picture](http://www.avertedimagination.com/img_pages/blue_fireball.html) of our Sun was taken last month in a specific red color of light emitted by hydrogen gas called [Hydrogen-alpha](http://www.solarobserving.com/halpha.htm) and then color inverted to appear blue. In this light, details of the Sun’s [chromosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosphere) are particularly visible, [highlighting](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050216.html) numerous thin tubes of magnetically-confined hot gas known as [spicules](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap081102.html) rising from the Sun like [bristles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristles) from a shag carpet. Our Sun glows because it is hot, but it is [not on fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire). [Fire](http://www.ci.phoenix.az.us/FIRE/homefire.html) is the rapid acquisition of oxygen, and there is very little [oxygen](http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/key/O.html) on the Sun. The energy source of our Sun is the nuclear [fusion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOxuGzYXHSQ) of hydrogen into [helium](http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/key/He.html) deep within its core. No [sunspots](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap031027.html) or [large active regions](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap090405.html) were visible on the Sun this day, although some [solar prominences](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap030707.html) are visible around the edges.
