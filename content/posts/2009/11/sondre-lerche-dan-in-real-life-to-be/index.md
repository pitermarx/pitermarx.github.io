    I’m not going to say that you ever stop to think along the way
    But baby, be prepared to be surprised. You better be prepared to be surprised.
    Baby, be prepared to be surprised It’s all I know

    I’m not going to state obvious observations everybody makes
    But baby, be prepared to be surprised. You better be prepared to be surprised
    Baby, be prepared to be surprised It’s all I know

    The weight of the world and the hurt and the dirt
    Can make you disturbed but I heard, but I heard

    When I wrap my arms around you every mistake we made crumbles
    When I wrap my arms around you everything echoes a new song

    I’m not gonna whine or scream out I’m so tired through the mike
    But baby, be prepared to be surprised. You got to be prepared to be surprised
    Baby, be prepared to be surprised It’s all I know

    The weight of the world and the hurt and the dirt
    Can make you disturbed but I heard, but I heard

    When I wrap my arms around you every mistake we made crumbles
    When I wrap my arms around you everything echoes a new song

    I’m not gonna lie saying everyone’s gonna be alright and fine until we die
    But what else can you do but hope and pray and save
    And we’ll get by

    Be prepared to be surprised
    Better be prepared to be surprised
    You got to be prepared to be surprised
    It’s all I know
