**Sondre Lerche - Dan in Real Life -** **To Be Surprised**

I’m not going to say that you ever stop to think along the way  
But baby, be prepared to be surprised. You better be prepared to be surprised.  
Baby, be prepared to be surprised It’s all I know

I’m not going to state obvious observations everybody makes  
But baby, be prepared to be surprised. You better be prepared to be surprised  
Baby, be prepared to be surprised It’s all I know

The weight of the world and the hurt and the dirt  
Can make you disturbed but I heard, but I heard

When I wrap my arms around you every mistake we made crumbles  
When I wrap my arms around you everything echoes a new song  
  
I’m not gonna whine or scream out I’m so tired through the mike  
But baby, be prepared to be surprised. You got to be prepared to be surprised  
Baby, be prepared to be surprised It’s all I know  
  
The weight of the world and the hurt and the dirt  
Can make you disturbed but I heard, but I heard

When I wrap my arms around you every mistake we made crumbles  
When I wrap my arms around you everything echoes a new song  
  
I’m not gonna lie saying everyone’s gonna be alright and fine until we die  
But what else can you do but hope and pray and save  
And we’ll get by  
  
Be prepared to be surprised  
Better be prepared to be surprised  
You got to be prepared to be surprised  
It’s all I know
