  There’s a place that I know where the sycamores grow
  and daffodils have their fun
  Where the cares of the day seems to slowly fade away
  in the glow of the evening sun
  Peace when the day is done

  If I go there real late
  let my mind meditate on everything to be done
  If I search deep inside
  let my conscience be my guide
  Then the answers are sure to come
  don’t have to worry none

  When you find a piece of mind leave you worries behind
  don’t say that it can’t be done
  With a new point of view life’s true meaning comes to you
  and the freedom you seek is won

  Peace is for everyone
  Peace is for everyone
  Peace is for everyone
