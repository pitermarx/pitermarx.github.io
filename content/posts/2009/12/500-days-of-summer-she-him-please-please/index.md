  Good times for a change 
  See, the luck I’ve had 
  Can make a good man 
  Turn bad 

  So please please please 
  Let me, let me, let me 
  Let me get what I want 
  This time 

  Haven’t had a dream in a long time
  See, the life I’ve had 
  Can make a good man turn bad 

  So for once in my life 
  Let me get what I want 
  Lord knows, it would be the first time 
  Lord knows, it would be the first time
