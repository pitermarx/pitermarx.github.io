  The way you look at me when you think I’m not looking, tells me…. 
  Your heart’s, a sleeping giant worn out by someone you loved before me. 
  I see you’re scared unconvinced by what I’ve tried to say; 
  That I am yours and that nothing will take me away. 

  I know that you know but I’ll sing it again; 
  I love you babe and nothing will take me away

  The way you always call me with some question and every time
  Try to pretend you didn’t call me just ‘cause I was on your mind. 
  Too soon for you to say out loud but I know. 
  You love me and though we don’t say it already shows. 

  I know that you know but I’ll sing it again; 
  I love you babe and nothing will take me away. 
  You already know but I’ll sing it again; 
  I love you babe and nothing will take me away.

  I wait for you to open up. But, it’s not a bore. 
  You’re just what I’ve been looking for. 
  Why do you keep your head in the sand? 
  Whoever you loved before me that ran's 
  Nothing like me… 
  Nothing like me… 
  Nothing like me… 

  I know that you know but I’ll sing it again; 
  I love you babe and nothing will take me away. 
  You already know but I’ll sing it again; 
  I love you babe and nothing will take me away.

  The way you look at me when you think I’m not looking. 
  The way you call me up just to see what’s cooking. 
  The way you look at me when you think I’m not looking. 
  I look at you that way too you just don’t know that I do. 

  I know that you know. You already know
