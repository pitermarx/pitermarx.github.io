While it may be necessary to use code to build value on software projects, there are many not so great things that increase the more code we have. Let’s make the **10 commandments of** _**No Code™**_!

1. _No Code_ has no bugs
2. _No Code_ has no technical debt
3. _No Code_ has no cognitive load on developers
4. _No Code_ builds in no time
5. _No Code_ does checkout in no time
6. _No Code_ makes our tooling faster
7. _No Code_ has 100% code coverage
8. _No Code_ is easier to read than some code
9. _No Code_ scales infinitely
10. _No Code_ is no one's problem

In the impossibility to write _No Code™,_ let’s simply write less code.  
Let’s only write the minimum code necessary.  
Let’s delete all unnecessary or unused code! (while keeping all functionality)
