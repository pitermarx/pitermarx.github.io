Just read [this article](https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/). A written version of a talk by Florian Haas about

- What modes we have _available_ for communications in teams;
- Why distributed teams always collaborate _asynchronously,_ and what communication modes lend themselves to that particularly well;
- Why _written communication_ is so important in distributed teams;
- And why _meetings_ (like video calls) are a mode of communication that effective distributed teams hardly ever need to use — except for very specific reasons.

My favorite part was this 5-paragraph format for briefing people.

* * *

Whenever you need to thoroughly **brief a group of people on an important matter,** consider using a **5-paragraph format.**

1. Situation
2. Mission
3. Execution
4. Logistics
5. Command and Signal

Let’s break these down in a little detail:

1. Situation is about what position we’re in, and **why** we set out to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your own company, any extra help that is available, and the current market.
2. Objective is **what** we want to achieve.
3. Plan is **how** we want to achieve it.
4. Logistics is about what budget and resources are available, and how they are used.
5. Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves and with others in order to achieve your goal.
