I've been thinking about the stuff I depend upon to keep this blog, and in particular about [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot).

Most of the stuff I post here is sharing something I saw elsewhere.

I depend on other sites I link to to keep the links alive. I could mitigate this by always linking via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), but I would also be dependent on them...

I depend on YouTube for the videos I share. I could copy and host them myself, but that would increase a LOT the cost of keeping all the stuff. I depend on Spotify for the songs I share. I could copy the audio and host them myself, but that might be considered a copyright violation.

And even for stuff I own and have a backup for, I depend on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pitermarx/) to keep my photos, on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pitermarx) to keep my music, on [GitHub](https://github.com/pitermarx) to keep my code. The list goes on and on...

Dependence and trust. This is what makes the web go round.

Speaking of trust...

Should I go live in a cabin in the woods?
