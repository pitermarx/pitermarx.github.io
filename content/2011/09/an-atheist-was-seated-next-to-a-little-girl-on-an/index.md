An atheist was seated next to a little girl on an airplane and he turned to her and said, _Do you want to talk? Flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger …_

The little girl, who had just started to read her book, replied to the total stranger, _What would you want to talk about?_ _Oh, I don’t know_, said the atheist. _How about w__hy there is no God, or no Heaven or Hell, or no life after death?_ as he smiled smugly. _OK,_ she said. _Those could be interesting topics but let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same stuff - grass. Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, but a horse produces clumps. Why do you suppose that is?_

The atheist, visibly surprised by the little girl’s intelligence, thinks about it and says, _Hmmm, I have no idea._ To which the little girl replied, _Do you really feel qualified to discuss why there is no God, or no Heaven or Hell, or no life after death, when you don’t know crap?_
