> Euclid’s _Elements_ is an impressive achievement. Written in Greek around 300 BC (though presumably including many earlier results), the _Elements_ in effect defined the way formal mathematics is done for more than two thousand years. The [basic idea](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-9--history-of-concept-of-mathematics/) is to start from certain axioms that are assumed to be true, then—without any further “input from outside”—use purely deductive methods to establish a collection of theorems.  
>   
> Euclid effectively had 10 axioms ([5 “postulates”](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Euc.+1.Post.&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0086) and [5 “common notions”](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Euc.+1.CN&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0086)), like “one can draw a straight line from any point to any other point”, or “things which equal the same thing are also equal to one another”. (One of his axioms was his [fifth postulate](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0086%3Abook%3D1%3Atype%3DPost%3Anumber%3D5)—that parallel lines never meet—which might seem obvious, but which actually turns out not to be true for physical curved space in our universe.)  
>   
> On the basis of his axioms, Euclid then gave 465 theorems.

Now I wish I could read greek...
